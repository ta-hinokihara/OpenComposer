    # B : Job arrays only: job array is begun
    # E : Job is exiting after having run
    # F : Job is finished. Job has completed execution, job failed during execution, or job was canceled.
    # H : Job is held. A job is put into a held state by the server or by a user or administrator. A job stays in a held state
    #     until it is released by a user or administrator.
    # M : Job was moved to another server
    # Q : Job is queued, eligible to run or be routed
    # R : Job is running
    # S : Job is suspended by server. A job is put into the suspended state when a higher priority job needs the resources.
    # T : Job is in transition (being moved to a new location)
    # U : Job is suspended due to workstation becoming busy
    # W : Job is waiting for its requested execution time to be reached or job specified a stagein request which failed for some reason.
    # X : Subjobs only; subjob is finished (expired.)
